This is an open-source Extention to improve the look & feel of sites running the DQ Q&A pro plugin. It's an alternative to the 'flat', 'helpdesk' and 'default' style. After 7 months of development, I have open-sourced my project.<p>

  INSTALLATION: public html >> website name >> wp content >> dw question answer pro >> styles>> upload the file.
